WIP: This is Ambiance (Ubuntu default theme) for Gnome Shell 3.6

Based on the theme created by "half-left": http://half-left.deviantart.com/art/GNOME-Shell-Ubuntu-Precise-Pangolin-302894685?q=boost%3Apopular%20in%3Acustomization%2Fskins%2Flinuxutil%2Fdesktopenv%2Fgnome%2Fgnome%20ubuntu&qo=1 for GS 3.4

Besided a working notifications area, the theme also contains some changes that I liked more (no more bold fonts!).

Install in a folder in ~/.themes/
